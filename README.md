# Vulnerable-Environment-With-Automated-Remediator
This is a small personal project to get me more familiar with AWS and Cloud Security concepts.  I recently got my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, but want to get some more hands on experience with the platform. 

## Goal
To intentionally deploy a small insecure aws test environment and build a Lambda-based Remediator that automatically fixes common issues.
I will then schedule remediation checks with EventBridge. 

I plan on also using this opportunity to get some experience using Terraform to do some simple provisioning.
